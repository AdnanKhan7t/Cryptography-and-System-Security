# Cryptography-and-System-Security
This repository supports learning for the "Cryptography and System Security" course. It covers symmetric and asymmetric encryption (e.g., DES, RSA), cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA), public key infrastructure, authentication protocols (e.g., Kerberos), and network security practices. Includes notes, code examples, and practical exercises.

This repository is a learning resource for the "Cryptography and System Security" course, covering essential topics and techniques to understand and apply security measures in computing. Key areas include:

1)Fundamentals of Cryptography: Understanding symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods, such as DES and RSA algorithms, along with block and stream ciphers, and cryptographic hash functions like SHA. <br>
2)Cryptographic Techniques: Applying substitution and transportation techniques, creating message digests, and implementing digital signatures.<br>
3)Public Key Infrastructure: Learning about public key cryptosystems, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and effective key management practices.<br>
4)Authentication and Security Practices: Exploring authentication protocols like Kerberos, key distribution methods, and public key infrastructure.<br>
5)Network and Web Security: Studying intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, IPsec architecture, and web security protocols such as SSL and TLS.<br>
